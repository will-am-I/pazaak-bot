# Pazaak Discord Bot

Pazaak is a card game from [Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic) and [Star Wars: Knights of 
the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_II:_The_Sith_Lords). It is similar to Black Jack in that you 
cannot go over 20, however you have a side deck you can play cards from to add to or subtract from your total. View the [wiki](https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pazaak/Legends) 
for more information on how to play and use cards.
